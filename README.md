### How to run this project

This project uses the library node-sass to compile .scss files to .css:

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "node-sass": "^4.12.0"
  }
```

### Commands

If you have installed live-server in your machine, you can run this command to launch the project:

```

### Scripts

This script in the package.json file is the responsible for compiling sass:

```json
"compile:sass": "node-sass sass/main.scss css/style.css"
```

You can add the "-w" flag to the script to make the compiler to watch for changes:

```json
"compile:sass": "node-sass sass/main.scss css/style.css -w"
```
